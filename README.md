# Session 11 / in class exercise

## Team Info
- Eliza
- David

### Setup

We are going to split into groups of two. Each team should collaborate to reach our goal. It's gonna be like the idea of [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). Engagement of both the students in coding is important. How to split the work is totally up to the teams (i.e. one person for front-end and the other for back-end). 

Start from planning. Before you jump into coding, take 5-10 minutes to define your approach and steps within your team. Maybe draw a simple sketch of your design. While one person is coding, the other team member is responsible to provoke ideas, make sure of code validity, recommend better ways of implementation or **most importantly ask questions if he/she doesn't understand something**.

I will be roaming around between teams. You can ask me questions or Google them :). You **should** push your project to this repository before you leave the class.

The base scaffold provided is nothing but the structure. Make your project as nice/functional as you can. But, **don't over complicate it**. Start with the minimal feasible goal and improve if you had time.

This is an opportunity to teach and learn together. Let's make it fun and productive.

### Goal

Your goal is to build a very simple Todo list application. Here are some examples:

[https://github.com/component/todo](https://github.com/component/todo)

[http://dreamerslab.com/blog/en/write-a-todo-list-with-express-and-mongodb/](http://dreamerslab.com/blog/en/write-a-todo-list-with-express-and-mongodb/)

Provided within this repository is a basic scaffold that includes an `express` application that runs a serve on `localhost:3000`. Run the server with: `npm start`. Build your application on tip of this scaffold.

You are allowed to use third party libraries/tools like JQuery/Bootstrap.

#### Required features

- Add new item.
- Remove existing items.
- Viewer should be able to see all the existing items.
- Each Item should at least have a description.
- List should be persistent upon reloading the page. In other words, it should be persistent as long as the server instance is running.

#### Bonus features

- Update existing items.
- Improve UX/UI by adding signifiers for successful save/remove/update of items on server.
- Save the items on server. In other words, make it persistent. (Save it in a `.json` file or a database if interested/checkout `mongoose` )
